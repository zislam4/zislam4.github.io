	<h1>Zabir Islam</h1>
	<p>I'm a sophomore at Tufts University from Dhaka, Bangladesh, currently studying Computer Science. I also enjoy doing mock trial for Tufts, exploring Boston looking for good food, playing ping pong, and researching the history of doorknobs and toilet paper. I'm also an avid Calvin and Hobbes fan.</p>
